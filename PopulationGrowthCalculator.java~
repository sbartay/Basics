 * @(#)PopulationGrowthCalculator
 * @author Saffi Bartay
 * @version 1.00 09/04/2017
 * 
 * PROGRAM PURPOSE: Based on the current annual population
 * of 7.5 billion and growth rate of 0.1%, calculate the
 * world population after one, two, and three years. Prompt
 * for the world population and growth rate.
 */

/**
 * The current world population and its growth rate are 
 * prompted for. The calculations are as follows:
 * 
 * Multiply the world population value by 1 billion in the 
 * same statement as the read for the value.
 * 
 * After year 1: Future population value by 1 billion in the
 * same statement as the read for the value. 
 * 
 * After year 2: Future population is current population
 * multiplied by 1 plus growth rate. 
 * 
 * After year 3: Same formula as year 2.
